Forked from the mirror of the original script at https://github.com/chazy/dirsettings 

Dirsettings allow you to customize the behavior of VIM in a single subtree
by placing a .vimdir file in the root of that directory.

Extremely useful when hacking Android and Linux kernel at the same time
for example.

This fork contains updates to allow for multiple heirarchical .vimdir
files. All .vimdir files found upwards in the directory tree are sourced, with
the nearest being sourced last to overwrite any settings in higher directories.

Also the current working directory is automatically changed to that of the
nearest .vimdir file.
